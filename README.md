# Dartboard Dectector
Created using Python with [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/).

Program was first trained of a series of dartboarf images. After training the program uses the Viola-Jones algorithm combined with two hough transforms to detect dartboards in images.

- We used the Viola-Jones detector to generate boxes around dartboards and other similar images. This produced lots of boxes and a high False Positive Rate (FPR).
- We combined the Viola-Jones output with the Hough Circle Transform to remove false positives.
- To help in cases where the dartboards were not detected as circles, we calculate a Hough Line Transform and find intersections of lines meeting a criteria. We combined this into a voting system with the Hough Circle output to remove boxes that didnâ€™t contain the features of a dartboard.
- We kept a box if it contained more than 5 circle centres, or if it contained more than 20 diagonal line intersections..
